### Development Workflow

We are using GitHub flow, which is simple way to manage branches in a repository.

-   **Main branch**: The `main` branch is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.
    
-   **Develop branch**: The `develop` branch is where development happens.
    
-   **Feature branches**: Feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release.
    
-   **Release branches**: Release branches support preparation of a new production release.
    
-   **Hotfix branches**: Hotfix branches are used to quickly patch production releases.
